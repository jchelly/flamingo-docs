Particle properties in the particle lightcones
==============================================

This page documents all of the properties which are stored for each
type of particle in the FLAMINGO lightcone particle outputs.

In the Units column in the tables below we use :math:`a` to indicate
the expansion factor. Comoving megaparsecs are expressed as
:math:`a\mathrm{Mpc}`, but note that the expansion factor varies with
comoving distance from the observer so coordinates cannot be converted
to physical units with a simple multiplication. In the Shape column, N
indicates the number of particles in the dataset.

particle files. This group contains HDF5 datasets which store the
