Particle lightcones
===================

Particle lightcone outputs record every particle which crossed the
observer's lightcone out to some maximum redshift. At high redshift
the volume and number of particles in the lightcone becomes extremely
large, so for each particle type there is an upper redshift limit
beyond which particles are not output.
