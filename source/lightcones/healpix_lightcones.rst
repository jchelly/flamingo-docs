HEALPix maps
============

The FLAMINGO simulation lightcone outputs include full-sky projected
maps of particle properties (such as mass or x-ray luminosity) in
concentric spherical shells around the observer. When a particle
crosses the observer's lightcone we determine which radial shell it is
in and accumulate its contribution to the appropriate maps.

These maps use the `HEALPix <https://healpix.sourceforge.io/>`__
pixelisation scheme to divide the sky into pixels of equal area. The
maps are provided at two resolutions. The highest resolution maps have
an angular resolution of about 13 arcseconds (:math:`N_\mathrm{side}=16384`).
Since these large maps can be difficult to work with, we also provide
down-sampled maps with an angular resolution of about 50 arcseconds
(:math:`N_\mathrm{side}=4096`).

       Projected gas mass in 10 concentric spherical shells around an
       observer in the ``L1_m8`` simulation. The observer is at the
       centre of the sphere. The outer sphere has a comoving radius of
       approximately 2 Gpc. The full FLAMINGO outputs consist of
       :doc:`68 shells <healpix_shell_redshifts>` with a maximum
       comoving radius of 7.9 Gpc (:math:`z = 5`).

       Mollweide projected full sky map of the thermal
       Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect as quantified by the Compton y
       parameter for the redshift interval :math:`0 < z < 0.05`.

HEALPix maps of a range of physical quantities are available. For more
information see the documentation links below and appendix A of
