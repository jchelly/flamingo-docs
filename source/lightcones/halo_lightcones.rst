Halo lightcones
===============

Lightcone halo catalogues extending to redshift :math:`z=15` have been
constructed by interpolating the HBT-HERONS halo catalogues between
snapshots using black hole particles as tracers of the halo
positions. Note that this causes incompleteness below the minimum halo
mass for seeding black holes. The seeding mass varies with simulation
resolution and is given by :math:`2.757 \times 10^{11}
\mathrm{M}_\odot (\mathrm{M_{gas}} /1.07 \times 10^9
\mathrm{M}_\odot)`, where :math:`\mathrm{M_{gas}}` is the gas particle
mass. In addition, any galaxies that have lost their black holes,
which is particularly relevant for satellites, are missing.  See the
links below for details.
