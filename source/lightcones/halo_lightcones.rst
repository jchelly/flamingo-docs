Halo lightcones
===============

Lightcone halo catalogues extending to redshift :math:`z=15` have been
constructed by interpolating the HBT-HERONS halo catalogues between
snapshots using black hole particles as tracers of the halo
positions. Note that this causes significant incompleteness at low
halo masses and high redshifts. See the links below for details.
