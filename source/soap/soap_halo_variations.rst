SOAP halo variations
====================

SOAP calculates properties for several definitions of a halo. These various types
give users the freedom to select the most appropriate definition for their scientific
use case.

.. _bound_subhalo_description:

Bound subhalo
-------------

Bound subhalo properties are computed for each subhalo identified by the subhalo finder,
irrespective of whether it is a central or satellite subhalo (or even
a satellite of satellite, and so on). They include all particles that the
subhalo finder has determined to be bound to the subhalo. Subhalo properties
are contained within the group ``bound_subhalo`` in the output file.

.. _exclusive_sphere_description:

Exclusive sphere
----------------

Exclusive sphere properties are similar to bound subhalo quantities, but
they include only the particles
that are bound to the subhalo and also satisfy an additional radial cut
(aperture). We use eight different aperture radii (10, 30, 50, 100, 300,
500, 1000, 3000 physical kpc), so that every subhalo has eight of these.
Exclusive sphere properties are contained within a group
``exclusive_sphere_XXXkpc``, where ``XXX`` is the corresponding aperture
radius.

.. _inclusive_sphere_description:

Inclusive sphere
----------------

Inclusive sphere properties use the same physical aperture radii as 
the exclusive sphere quantities,
but include all particles within the radius, regardless of their
membership status. They are stored within a group
``inclusive_sphere_XXXkpc``, where ``XXX`` is the corresponding aperture
radius.

.. _projected_aperture_description:

Exclusive projected aperture
----------------------------

The projected apertures are similar to exclusive sphere quantities, 
except that their aperture
filter is applied in 3 independent projections
along the x-, y- and z-axis. Along the projection axis, we do not apply
any radial cut, so that the depth corresponds to all particles bound to
the subhalo. With four projected aperture radii (10, 30, 50, 100
kpc), we then have twelve sets of projected aperture quantities for each
subhalo. Projected aperture quantities are stored in a group named
``projected_aperture_XXXkpc_projP``, where ``XXX`` is the corresponding
aperture radius, and ``P`` corresponds to a particular projection
direction (``x``, ``y`` or ``z``).

.. _spherical_overdensity_description:

Spherical overdensity
---------------------

Spherical overdensities are fundamentally different from the other
halo variations in that their
aperture radius is determined from the density profile and so has a different value
for each halo. They always include all particles within a sphere
centred on the most bound particle, regardless of particle subhalo membership. The
radius is either the radius at which the density reaches a certain
target value (50 crit, 100 crit, 200 crit, 500 crit, 1000 crit, 2500
crit, 200 mean,
`Bryan & Norman (1998) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998ApJ...495...80B>`__)
or a multiple of such a radius (5xR 500 crit).
See `Spherical overdensity calculations`_ for details about how the radii are
calculated.
Spherical overdensities are only computed for centrals,
i.e. field halos. The inclusive sphere quantities are stored in a group
``spherical_overdensity_XXX``, where ``XXX`` are the target density values
listed above.

Input Halos
-----------

Some properties are copied directly from the original subhalo catalogue
that was passed to SOAP. These are stored in a three separate groups.
``input_halos`` contains the fundamental properties required for SOAP
to run. ``input_halos_fof`` contains the FoF properties of the host of
each central subhalo. ``input_halos_hbtplus`` contains properties copied directly
from the HBT-HERONS catalogues.

SOAP
----

Some properties are computed by SOAP using the other halo properties
present in the catalogue. These are stored in a separate group,
``SOAP``. This is just done for convenience; these quantities can be
computed from the SOAP output alone.

Summary table
-------------

The table below lists all the groups in the output file that contain datasets.
Note that there will be three groups (``x``, ``y`` or ``z``) for each
projected aperture variation. Each halo variation can have a filter
applied to it. If a halo does not satisfy the filter then the variation
will not be calculated for that halo. More information on filters can be
found :doc:`in the next section <soap_filters>`.

Spherical overdensity calculations
----------------------------------

The radius at which the density reaches a certain threshold value is
found by linear interpolation of the cumulative mass profile obtained
after sorting the particles by radius. The process is as follows:

#. Discard any particles at zero radius, since we cannot compute a
   density for those. The mass of these particles is used as an
   :math:`r=0` offset for the cumulative mass profile. Since the halo centre
   is the position of the most bound particle, there should
   always be at least one such particle.

#. Sort remaining particles according to radius and construct the cumulative mass
   profile. :math:`R_{i}` gives the radius of the particles, and
   :math:`M_{i}` the cumulative mass up to and including that radius.

#. Construct the halo density profile,
   :math:`\rho_{i}`,
   by dividing the cumulative mass at
   every radius by the volume of the sphere with that radius.

#. Find intersection points between the density profile and the target
   density, i.e. the consecutive indices :math:`i_{low}`, :math:`i_{high}`
   where :math:`\rho_{low} > \rho_{target}` and 
   :math:`\rho_{high} < \rho_{target}`

#. To determine :math:`R_{\rm{}SO}` we solve

   .. math::
      \begin{equation}
          \frac{4\pi{}}{3} \rho{}_{\rm{}target} R_{\rm{}SO}^3 = M_{\rm{}low} + \left( \frac{M_{\rm{}high}-M_{\rm{}low}}{R_{\rm{}high} - R_{\rm{}low}} \right) \left(R_{\rm{}SO} - R_{\rm{}low}\right),
      \end{equation}

   This third degree polynomial equation has no unique solution, although 
   in practice only one of the three possible complex solutions is real. We 
   find this solution by using a root finding algorithm within the
   intersecting bin (we use Brent’s method for this).

#. From :math:`R_{\rm{}SO}`, we determine :math:`M_{\rm{}SO}` using

   .. math::
      \begin{equation}
      M_{\rm{}SO} = \frac{4\pi{}}{3} R_{\rm{}SO}^{3} \rho{}_{\rm{}target}
      \end{equation}

Neutrinos (if present in the model) are included in the spherical
overdensity calculation by adding both their weighted
masses (which can be negative), as well as the contribution from the
background neutrino density. The latter is achieved by explicitly adding
the cumulative mass profile at constant neutrino density to the total
cumulative mass profile before computing the density profile.

The SOAP process is different to that used by some halo finders, where 
both the mass and the radius are obtained from independent interpolations
on the mass and density profiles (the latter uses the logarithm of the
density in the interpolation).
