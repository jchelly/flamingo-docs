Snapshots
=========

FLAMINGO simulation snapshots record the full distribution of
particles in the simulation volume at an instant in time. The dark
matter only runs contain dark matter and neutrino particles. The hydro
runs also include gas, star and black hole particles.

The following sections describe the layout and contents of the snapshots.
