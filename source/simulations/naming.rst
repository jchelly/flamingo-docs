Naming conventions
==================

Box size
--------

Where the name of a simulation starts with ``LX_mY``, the value of ``X``
indicates the box size in comoving Gpc. All simulations without this
prefix were run in a 1Gpc box.

   :stub-columns: 0

   * - Label
     - Box side length (comoving Gpc)
   * - ``L1``
     - 1.0
   * - ``L2p8``
     - 2.8
   * - ``L5p6``
     - 5.6
   * - ``L11p2``
     - 11.2

Mass resolution
---------------

Where the name of a simulation starts with ``LX_mY``, the value of the
integer ``Y`` indicates the mass resolution of the simulation. It is
approximately equal to :math:`\log_{10}(m_{\mathrm{gas}})`, where
:math:`m_{\mathrm{gas}}` is the gas particle mass. All simulations
with no resolution specifier in their name were run at ``m9``
resolution.

.. note:: The exact particle masses vary slightly with the cosmology
          used in each simulation (see `this table
          <https://flamingo.strw.leidenuniv.nl/simulations.html>`__),
          and CDM particles in dark matter only runs have larger
          masses to account for the baryons. The values below are for
          hydro runs using the fiducial FLAMINGO cosmology.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 0

   * - Label
     - Gas particle mass (:math:`\mathrm{M_{\odot}}`)
     - CDM particle mass (:math:`\mathrm{M_{\odot}}`)
   * - ``m8``
     - :math:`1.34 \times 10^8`
     - :math:`7.06 \times 10^8`
   * - ``m9``
     - :math:`1.07 \times 10^9`
     - :math:`5.65 \times 10^9`
   * - ``m10``
     - :math:`8.56 \times 10^9`
     - :math:`4.52 \times 10^{10}`

Model variations
----------------

Simulations with names which do not start with the ``LX_mY`` prefix
are model variations run in 1Gpc boxes at the fiducial ``m9``
resolution.

Dark matter only models
-----------------------

Dark matter only models are indicated with a ``_DMO`` suffix. For
example, the dark matter only 1Gpc box at ``m9`` resolution is
``L1_m9_DMO``.
